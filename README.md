# Grid-Demo-1
Experiment to have ai build advanced gridO

# Overview
create a new nextjs project. create an advanced datagrid with the following abilities: show or hide columns, sort by one or more columns, the ability to group by columns (one or more) and the ability to save and restore the layout. Create a step by step detailed plan. take a deep breath. create unit tests for each major feature. run unit tests to determine if a feature is working as it should. fix failing unit tests (preferable the grid feature and not the unit test). Use an in memory repository of patients. seed it with 100 patients. track progress at each step.
